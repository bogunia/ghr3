## Project Status

I used grommet and react-query in this project.

The username for the GitHub user is parsed from the URL path. A list of repositories for the user is generated. 
Each list item contains the following: name, description, stars, language. 
Each repository name links to that repository in GitHub when clicked. 

The username is displayed on the page. The username links to the userâ€™s profile in GitHub when clicked.

To do: pass a token with the requests and add pagination.

To improve quality: 
Move some pieces to components. 
Handling of corner cases - better messages, make more consistent (e.g. when no public repositories).
Add onClick to a row.
Add unit tests.
